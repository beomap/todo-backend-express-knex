## The Todos App

### Codebase Analysis

- We have a simple Node.js backend built with Express and Knex, connected to a PostgreSQL database.
- Thereâ€™s a set of basic CRUD operations around a single todos table.
- Tests are set up using Jest to verify CRUD functionality.
- Frontend: skip as we only update the backend in this assignment

- Missing setup

  - No typescript
  - A proper ORM lib

- Missing features
  - Authentication/Authorization: Currently, there is no login system or user roles.
  - Group todos by Org and Project
  - Assigning/Unassigning todos
  - Comment on a todo
  - Notifications

### Implementation plan

- Setup typescript and ORM
- Restructure the server
- Feature being implemented

  - Authentication/Authorization
  - Group todos by Org and Project
  - Assign/Unassign a todos
  - Comment on a todo

- ERD design
- API design
