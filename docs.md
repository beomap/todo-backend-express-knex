## The Todos App

### Codebase Analysis

- We have a simple Node.js backend built with Express and Knex, connected to a PostgreSQL database.
- Thereâ€™s a set of basic CRUD operations around a single todos table.
- Tests are set up using Jest to verify CRUD functionality.
- Frontend: skip as we only update the backend in this assignment

- Missing setup

  - No typescript
  - A proper ORM lib

- Missing features

  - Group todos by Org and Project
  - Assigning/Unassigning tasks
  - Comment on a task
